This repo contains my atom styles file.

The assumption is that after following [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@docodemore/an-alternative-to-operator-mono-font-6e5d040e1c7e), and installing the coda-fira and flott flott system fonts, my atom editor will always be styled as expected.

Caveat: i don't write less for a living, and have no
immediate interest in learning how to do so.
